#Graph Algorithms
	This is an implementation from the Graph Algoritms in Ruby.
### Algorithms

## Graph Strucutre
We get a simulation of a Adjacency List, for example:

v1,v2,v3/1,2
v2,v1/1
v3,v2/4

It means that We have three vertexes, respectively: v1,v2 and v3.
And this vertexes are weights: 
w(v1 -> v2) = 1
w(v1 -> v3) = 2

w(v2 -> v1) = 1

w(v3 -> v2) = 4
